Limmat has been tested under Sparc Solaris 2.[78], Linux Intel i686, Mac OS
X and Linux Alpha with various compilers, though GNU gcc was mainly used.
As a first step run the 'configure' script which will generate the
'Makefile'.  Per default optimizations are enabled.  For debugging purposes
you may want to enable other options.  Refer to the usage of the configure
script by running './configure -h' for more information.

Then issuing 'make' will produce the library 'liblimmat.a', which has the
API documented in 'limmat.h' and a stand alone application 'limmat'.  In
addition have a look at the define section at the top of 'limmat.c', where
additional runtime checks can be enabled.  To compile the test cases issue
'make white' which will produce the test driver 'white'.  Run it to see
whether everything is OK.  There is no installation target.
