	  Some of the various things that Linux supports (such as network
	  drivers, file systems, network protocols, etc.) can be in a state
	  of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
	  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
	  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
	  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
	  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
	  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
	  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
	  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
	  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
	  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
	  (before submitting bug reports, please read the documents
	  <file:README>, <file:MAINTAINERS>, <file:REPORTING-BUGS>,
	  <file:Documentation/BUG-HUNTING>, and
	  <file:Documentation/oops-tracing.txt> in the kernel source).

	  This option will also make obsoleted drivers available. These are
	  drivers that have been replaced by something else, and/or are
	  scheduled to be removed in a future kernel release.

	  Unless you intend to help test and develop a feature or driver that
	  falls into this category, or you have a situation that requires
	  using these features, you should probably say N here, which will

	  The linux kernel is a kind of self-extracting executable.

	  in efficiency, compression and decompression speed.
	  Compression speed is only relevant when building a kernel.
	  Decompression speed is relevant at each boot.

	  If you have any problems with bzip2 or lzma compressed
	  kernels, mail me (Alain Knaff) <alain@knaff.lu>. (An older
	  version of this functionality (bzip2 only), for 2.4, was
	  supplied by Christian Ludwig)

	  High compression options are mostly useful for users, who

	  XZ uses the LZMA2 algorithm and instruction set specific

	  code. The size of the kernel is about 30% smaller with XZ in
	  comparison to gzip. On architectures for which there is a BCJ
	  filter (i386, x86_64, ARM, IA-64, PowerPC, and SPARC), XZ
	  will create a few percent smaller kernel than plain LZMA.

	  The speed is about the same as with LZMA: The decompression
	  speed of XZ is better than that of bzip2 but worse than gzip
	  and LZO. Compression is slow.

config KERNEL_LZO
	bool "LZO"
	depends on HAVE_KERNEL_LZO

	  Its compression ratio is the poorest among the 4. The kernel

	help
	  Enable kernel support for various performance events provided
	  by software and hardware.

	  Software events are supported either built-in or via the
	  use of generic tracepoints.

	  Most modern CPUs support performance events via performance
	  counter registers. These registers count the number of certain
	  types of hw events: such as instructions executed, cachemisses
	  suffered, or branches mis-predicted - without slowing down the
	  kernel or applications. These registers can also trigger interrupts
	  when a threshold number of events have passed - and can thus be
	  used to profile the code that runs on that CPU.

	  The Linux Performance Event subsystem provides an abstraction of
	  these software and hardware event capabilities, available via a
	  system call and used by the "perf" utility in tools/perf/. It
	  provides per task and per CPU counters, and it provides event
	  capabilities on top of those.

	  This is taken advantage of by uClibc's malloc(), and also by
	  ELF-FDPIC binfmt's brk and stack allocator.

	  Because of the obvious security issues, this option should only be
	  enabled on embedded devices where you control what is run in

	  Linux can use up to 64 Gigabytes of physical memory on x86 systems.
	  However, the address space of 32-bit x86 processors is only 4
	  Gigabytes large. That means that, if you have a large amount of
	  physical memory, not all of it can be "permanently mapped" by the
	  kernel. The physical memory that's not permanently mapped is called
	  "high memory".

	  If you are compiling a kernel which will never run on a machine with
	  more than 1 Gigabyte total physical RAM, answer "off" here (default
	  choice and suitable for most users). This will result in a "3GB/1GB"
	  split: 3GB are mapped so that each process sees a 3GB virtual memory
	  space and the remaining part of the 4GB virtual memory space is used
	  by the kernel to permanently map as much physical memory as
	  possible.

	  If the machine has between 1 and 4 Gigabytes physical RAM, then
	  answer "4GB" here.

	  If more than 4 Gigabytes is used then answer "64GB" here. This
	  selection turns Intel PAE (Physical Address Extension) mode on.
	  PAE implements 3-level paging on IA32 processors. PAE is fully
	  supported by Linux, PAE mode is implemented on all recent Intel
	  processors (Pentium Pro and better). NOTE: If you say "64GB" here,
	  then the kernel will not boot on CPUs that don't support PAE!

	  The actual amount of total physical memory will either be
	  auto detected or can be forced by using a kernel command line option
	  such as "mem=256M". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
	  kernel at boot time.)

config CLEANCACHE
	bool "Enable cleancache driver to cache clean pages if tmem is present"

	help
	  Cleancache can be thought of as a page-granularity victim cache
	  for clean pages that the kernel's pageframe replacement algorithm
	  (PFRA) would like to keep around, but can't since there isn't enough
	  memory.  So when the PFRA "evicts" a page, it first attempts to use
	  cleancache code to put the data contained in that page into
	  "transcendent memory", memory that is not directly accessible or
	  addressable by the kernel and is of unknown and possibly
	  time-varying size.  And when a cleancache-enabled
	  filesystem wishes to access a page in a file on disk, it first
	  checks cleancache to see if it already contains it; if it does,
	  the page is copied into the kernel and a disk access is avoided.
	  When a transcendent memory driver is available (such as zcache or
	  Xen transcendent memory), a significant I/O reduction
	  may be achieved.  When none is available, all cleancache calls
	  are reduced to a single pointer-compare-against-NULL resulting
	  in a negligible performance hit.

	  memory_corruption_check_period parameters in
	  Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt to adjust this.

	  When enabled with the default parameters, this option has
	  almost no overhead, as it reserves a relatively small amount
	  of memory and scans it infrequently.  It both detects corruption
	  and prevents it from affecting the running system.

	  It is, however, intended as a diagnostic tool; if repeatable
	  BIOS-originated corruption always affects the same memory,

	  The first page contains BIOS data structures that the kernel
	  must not use, so that page must always be reserved.

	  By default we reserve the first 64K of physical RAM, as a
	  number of BIOSes are known to corrupt that memory range
	  during events such as suspend/resume or monitor cable
	  insertion, so it must not be used by the kernel.

	  You can set this to 4 if you are absolutely sure that you
	  trust the BIOS to get all its memory reservations and usages
	  right.  If you know your BIOS have problems beyond the
	  default 64K area, you can set this to 640 to avoid using the
	  entire low memory range.

	  If you have doubts about the BIOS (e.g. suspend/resume does

	  hotplug events) then you might want to enable

config MATH_EMULATION
	bool

	---help---
	  Linux can emulate a math coprocessor (used for floating point

	  a math coprocessor built in, 486SX and 386 do not, unless you added
	  a 487DX or 387, respectively. (The messages during boot time can
	  give you some hints here ["man dmesg"].) Everyone needs either a
	  coprocessor or this emulation.

	  If you don't have a math coprocessor, you need to say Y here; if you
	  say Y here even though you have a coprocessor, the coprocessor will
	  be used nevertheless. (This behavior can be changed with the kernel
	  command line option "no387", which comes handy if your coprocessor
	  is broken. Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot
	  loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at
	  boot time.) This means that it is a good idea to say Y here if you
	  intend to use this kernel on different machines.

	  More information about the internals of the Linux math coprocessor
	  emulation can be found in <file:arch/x86/math-emu/README>.

	  If you are not sure, say Y; apart from resulting in a 66 KB bigger
	  kernel, it won't hurt.

config MTRR
	def_bool y
	prompt "MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support" if EXPERT
	---help---
	  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
	  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
	  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful if you have
	  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
	  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
	  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
	  of image write operations 2.5 times or more. Saying Y here creates a
	  /proc/mtrr file which may be used to manipulate your processor's
	  MTRRs. Typically the X server should use this.

	  This code has a reasonably generic interface so that similar
	  control registers on other processors can be easily supported
	  as well:

	  The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range
	  Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For
	  these, the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs.
	  The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and K6-3 processors have two
	  MTRRs. The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs, allowing
	  write-combining. All of these processors are supported by this code
	  and it makes sense to say Y here if you have one of them.

	  Saying Y here also fixes a problem with buggy SMP BIOSes which only
	  set the MTRRs for the boot CPU and not for the secondary CPUs. This
	  can lead to all sorts of problems, so it's good to say Y here.

	  You can safely say Y even if your machine doesn't have MTRRs, you'll
	  just add about 9 KB to your kernel.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine

	  This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded.

	  If kernel is a not relocatable (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n) then
	  bzImage will decompress itself to above physical address and
	  run from there. Otherwise, bzImage will run from the address where
	  it has been loaded by the boot loader and will ignore above physical
	  address.

	  In normal kdump cases one does not have to set/change this option
	  as now bzImage can be compiled as a completely relocatable image
	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y) and be used to load and run from a different
	  address. This option is mainly useful for the folks who don't want
	  to use a bzImage for capturing the crash dump and want to use a
	  vmlinux instead. vmlinux is not relocatable hence a kernel needs
	  to be specifically compiled to run from a specific memory area
	  (normally a reserved region) and this option comes handy.

	  So if you are using bzImage for capturing the crash dump,
	  leave the value here unchanged to 0x1000000 and set
	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.  Otherwise if you plan to use vmlinux
	  for capturing the crash dump change this value to start of
	  the reserved region.  In other words, it can be set based on
	  the "X" value as specified in the "crashkernel=YM@XM"
	  command line boot parameter passed to the panic-ed
	  kernel. Please take a look at Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt
	  for more details about crash dumps.

	  Usage of bzImage for capturing the crash dump is recommended as
	  one does not have to build two kernels. Same kernel can be used
	  as production kernel and capture kernel. Above option should have
	  gone away after relocatable bzImage support is introduced. But it
	  is present because there are users out there who continue to use
	  vmlinux for dump capture. This option should go away down the
	  line.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

	  One use is for the kexec on panic case where the recovery kernel
	  must live at a different physical address than the primary
	  kernel.

	  Note: If CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y, then the kernel runs from the address

	  If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and

	  address aligned to above value and run from there.

	  If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and
	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is not set, kernel will ignore the run time
	  load address and decompress itself to the address it has been
	  compiled for and run from there. The address for which kernel is

	  Enable the suspend to disk (STD) functionality, which is usually
	  called "hibernation" in user interfaces.  STD checkpoints the
	  system and powers it off; and restores that checkpoint on reboot.

	  You can suspend your machine with 'echo disk > /sys/power/state'
	  after placing resume=/dev/swappartition on the kernel command line
	  in your bootloader's configuration file.

	  Alternatively, you can use the additional userland tools available
	  from <http://suspend.sf.net>.

	  In principle it does not require ACPI or APM, although for example
	  ACPI will be used for the final steps when it is available.  One
	  of the reasons to use software suspend is that the firmware hooks
	  for suspend states like suspend-to-RAM (STR) often don't work very
	  well with Linux.

	  It creates an image which is saved in your active swap. Upon the next
	  boot, pass the 'resume=/dev/swappartition' argument to the kernel to
	  have it detect the saved image, restore memory state from it, and
	  continue to run as before. If you do not want the previous state to
	  be reloaded, then use the 'noresume' kernel command line argument.
	  Note, however, that fsck will be run on your filesystems and you will
	  need to run mkswap against the swap partition used for the suspend.

	  It also works with swap files to a limited extent (for details see
	  <file:Documentation/power/swsusp-and-swap-files.txt>).

	  Right now you may boot without resuming and resume later but in the
	  meantime you cannot use the swap partition(s)/file(s) involved in
	  suspending.  Also in this case you must not use the filesystems
	  that were mounted before the suspend.  In particular, you MUST NOT
	  MOUNT any journaled filesystems mounted before the suspend or they
	  will get corrupted in a nasty way.

	  Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) support for 
	  Linux requires an ACPI-compliant platform (hardware/firmware),
	  and assumes the presence of OS-directed configuration and power
	  management (OSPM) software.  This option will enlarge your 
	  kernel by about 70K.

	  Linux ACPI provides a robust functional replacement for several 
	  legacy configuration and power management interfaces, including
	  the Plug-and-Play BIOS specification (PnP BIOS), the 
	  MultiProcessor Specification (MPS), and the Advanced Power 
	  Management (APM) specification.  If both ACPI and APM support 
	  are configured, ACPI is used.

	  The project home page for the Linux ACPI subsystem is here:
	  <http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/acpi/>

	  Linux support for ACPI is based on Intel Corporation's ACPI
	  Component Architecture (ACPI CA).  For more information on the
	  ACPI CA, see:
	  <http://acpica.org/>

	  ACPI is an open industry specification co-developed by
	  Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, Phoenix, and Toshiba.

	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of

	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU

	---help---
	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
	  executables used across different architectures and operating
	  systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries
	  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
	  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
	  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
	  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
	  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
	  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
	  want to say Y here.

	  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
	  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then
	  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including

	  ELF FDPIC binaries are based on ELF, but allow the individual load
	  segments of a binary to be located in memory independently of each
	  other. This makes this format ideal for use in environments where no

	  The contents of an unmodified text mapping are omitted by default.

	  For an unmodified text mapping of an ELF object, including just
	  the first page of the file in a core dump makes it possible to
	  identify the build ID bits in the file, without paying the i/o
	  cost and disk space to dump all the text.  However, versions of
	  GDB before 6.7 are confused by ELF core dump files in this format.

	  The core dump behavior can be controlled per process using
	  the /proc/PID/coredump_filter pseudo-file; this setting is

	  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
	  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python, .NET or

	  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have
	  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of

          To use binfmt_misc, you will need to mount it:
		mount binfmt_misc -t binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc

	  will then be presented with several options that allow more precise
	  control about the routing process.

	  The answer to this question won't directly affect the kernel:
	  answering N will just cause the configurator to skip all the
	  questions about advanced routing.

	  Note that your box can only act as a router if you enable IP
	  forwarding in your kernel; you can do that by saying Y to "/proc
	  file system support" and "Sysctl support" below and executing the
	  line

	  echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

	  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

	  If you turn on IP forwarding, you should consider the rp_filter, which
	  automatically rejects incoming packets if the routing table entry
	  for their source address doesn't match the network interface they're
	  arriving on. This has security advantages because it prevents the
	  so-called IP spoofing, however it can pose problems if you use
	  asymmetric routing (packets from you to a host take a different path
	  than packets from that host to you) or if you operate a non-routing
	  host which has several IP addresses on different interfaces. To turn
	  rp_filter on use:

	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<device>/rp_filter
	   or
	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter

config ARPD

	  The kernel maintains an internal cache which maps IP addresses to

	  layer. Normally, kernel uses the ARP protocol to resolve these
	  mappings.

	  Saying Y here adds support to have an user space daemon to do this

config SYN_COOKIES
	bool "IP: TCP syncookie support"
	---help---
	  Normal TCP/IP networking is open to an attack known as "SYN
	  flooding". This denial-of-service attack prevents legitimate remote
	  users from being able to connect to your computer during an ongoing
	  attack and requires very little work from the attacker, who can
	  operate from anywhere on the Internet.

	  SYN cookies provide protection against this type of attack. If you
	  say Y here, the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge
	  protocol known as "SYN cookies" to enable legitimate users to
	  continue to connect, even when your machine is under attack. There
	  is no need for the legitimate users to change their TCP/IP software;
	  SYN cookies work transparently to them. For technical information
	  about SYN cookies, check out <http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html>.

	  If you are SYN flooded, the source address reported by the kernel is
	  likely to have been forged by the attacker; it is only reported as
	  an aid in tracing the packets to their actual source and should not
	  be taken as absolute truth.

	  SYN cookies may prevent correct error reporting on clients when the
	  server is really overloaded. If this happens frequently better turn
	  them off.

	  If you say Y here, you can disable SYN cookies at run time by
	  saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

	  echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies

menuconfig NETFILTER
	bool "Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)"
	---help---
	  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
	  that pass through your Linux box.

	  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
	  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
	  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
	  filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
	  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
	  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
	  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
	  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
	  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
	  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
	  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
	  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
	  you say Y here.

	  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
	  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
	  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
	  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
	  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
	  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
	  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
	  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
	  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
	  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
	  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
	  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
	  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
	  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
	  called NAT (Network Address Translation).

	  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
	  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
	  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
	  typically a caching proxy server.

	  Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using
	  a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables "see"
	  the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet
	  protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter
	  configuration).

	  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
	  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
	  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
	  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
	  these packages.

	  Note the table size must be power of 2. The table size will be the
	  value of 2 to the your input number power. The number to choose is
	  from 8 to 20, the default number is 12, which means the table size
	  is 4096. Don't input the number too small, otherwise you will lose
	  performance on it. You can adapt the table size yourself, according
	  to your virtual server application. It is good to set the table size
	  not far less than the number of connections per second multiplying
	  average lasting time of connection in the table.  For example, your
	  virtual server gets 200 connections per second, the connection lasts
	  for 200 seconds in average in the connection table, the table size
	  should be not far less than 200x200, it is good to set the table
	  size 32768 (2**15).

	  Another note that each connection occupies 128 bytes effectively and
	  each hash entry uses 8 bytes, so you can estimate how much memory is
	  needed for your box.

	  You can overwrite this number setting conn_tab_bits module parameter

	  originally defined in RFC 2661, is a standard method for

	  L2TP has since been adopted for tunneling a number of other
	  L2 protocols, including ATM, Frame Relay, HDLC and even raw

	  Novell client ncpfs (available from
	  <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/>) or from
	  within the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO,

	  to do the former, you'll also have to say Y to "NCP file system
	  support", below.

	  IPX is similar in scope to IP, while SPX, which runs on top of IPX,
	  is similar to TCP.

	  To turn your Linux box into a fully featured NetWare file server and
	  IPX router, say Y here and fetch either lwared from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/daemons/> or
	  mars_nwe from <ftp://www.compu-art.de/mars_nwe/>. For more

	  Every IPX network has an address that identifies it. Sometimes it is

	  (for example if your box is acting as a file server for different
	  IPX networks: it will then be accessible from everywhere using the
	  same address). The way this is done is to create a virtual internal
	  "network" inside your box and to assign an IPX address to this
	  network. Say Y here if you want to do this; read the IPX-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto> for details.

	  The full internal IPX network enables you to allocate sockets on
	  different virtual nodes of the internal network. This is done by
	  evaluating the field sipx_node of the socket address given to the
	  bind call. So applications should always initialize the node field
	  to 0 when binding a socket on the primary network. In this case the
	  socket is assigned the default node that has been given to the
	  kernel when the internal network was created. By enabling the full
	  internal IPX network the cross-forwarding of packets targeted at
	  'special' sockets to sockets listening on the primary network is
	  disabled. This might break existing applications, especially RIP/SAP
	  daemons. A RIP/SAP daemon that works well with the full internal net
	  can be found on <ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs/>.

	  Fast RR will make IrLAP send out a RR frame immediately when

	  frame. One forked process per event can create so many processes
	  that it creates a high system load, or on smaller systems
	  it is known to create out-of-memory situations during bootup.

	  To disable user space helper program execution at early boot

	  It provides a fully functional /dev directory, where usually

	  symlinks.
	  In very limited environments, it may provide a sufficient
	  functional /dev without any further help. It also allows simple

	  useful if your root file system requires a device that uses
	  such firmware and do not wish to use an initrd.

	  This single option controls the inclusion of firmware for

	  use an initrd).

	  This option is a string and takes the (space-separated) names of the
	  firmware files -- the same names that appear in MODULE_FIRMWARE()
	  and request_firmware() in the source. These files should exist under
	  the directory specified by the EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR option, which is
	  by default the firmware subdirectory of the kernel source tree.

	  For example, you might set CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="usb8388.bin", copy
	  the usb8388.bin file into the firmware directory, and build the kernel.
	  Then any request_firmware("usb8388.bin") will be satisfied internally
	  without needing to call out to userspace.

	  WARNING: If you include additional firmware files into your binary
	  kernel image that are not available under the terms of the GPL,

          Synchronous operation (i.e. always writing data to the host's disk

	  drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices
	  are block special device files with major number 7 and typically
	  called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.

	  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before
	  burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first
	  writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid
	  the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete
	  root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device
	  driver.

	  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility, found in the
	  util-linux package, see
	  <ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/>.

	  The loop device driver can also be used to "hide" a file system in
	  a disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption
	  (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low
	  bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides
	  on a remote file server.

	  There are several ways of encrypting disks. Some of these require
	  kernel patches. The vanilla kernel offers the cryptoloop option
	  and a Device Mapper target (which is superior, as it supports all
	  file systems). If you want to use the cryptoloop, say Y to both
	  LOOP and CRYPTOLOOP, and make sure you have a recent (version 2.12
	  or later) version of util-linux. Additionally, be aware that
	  the cryptoloop is not safe for storing journaled filesystems.

	  NOTE: In order to authenticate connections you have to select
	  CRYPTO_HMAC and a hash function as well.

	  DRBD is a shared-nothing, synchronously replicated block device. It
	  is designed to serve as a building block for high availability
	  clusters and in this context, is a "drop-in" replacement for shared
	  storage. Simplistically, you could see it as a network RAID 1.

	  Each minor device has a role, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'.
	  On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to
	  run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to
	  the local 'lower level block device' and, across the network, to the
	  node with the device in 'secondary' state.  The secondary device
	  simply writes the data to its lower level block device.

	  DRBD can also be used in dual-Primary mode (device writable on both
	  nodes), which means it can exhibit shared disk semantics in a
	  shared-nothing cluster.  Needless to say, on top of dual-Primary
	  DRBD utilizing a cluster file system is necessary to maintain for
	  cache coherency.

	  For automatic failover you need a cluster manager (e.g. heartbeat).

	  If you have built SCSI as modules, enabling this option can
	  be a problem as the devices may not have been found by the
	  time your system expects them to have been.  You can load the
	  scsi_wait_scan module to ensure that all scans have completed.
	  If you build your SCSI drivers into the kernel, then everything
	  will work fine if you say Y here.

	Specify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI
	device when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.

	This is an upper bound value for the number of tagged transactions
	to be used for any device.  The aic7xxx driver will automatically
	vary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a
	fixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum
	and display a console message indicating this value.

	Due to resource allocation issues in the Linux SCSI mid-layer, using

	  WARNING This driver is an older aic7xxx driver and is no longer
	  under active development.  Adaptec, Inc. is writing a new driver to
	  take the place of this one, and it is recommended that whenever
	  possible, people should use the new Adaptec written driver instead
	  of this one.  This driver will eventually be phased out entirely.

	  This is support for the various aic7xxx based Adaptec SCSI
	  controllers. These include the 274x EISA cards; 284x VLB cards;
	  2902, 2910, 293x, 294x, 394x, 3985 and several other PCI and
	  motherboard based SCSI controllers from Adaptec. It does not support
	  the AAA-13x RAID controllers from Adaptec, nor will it likely ever
	  support them. It does not support the 2920 cards from Adaptec that
	  use the Future Domain SCSI controller chip. For those cards, you
	  need the "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" driver.

	  In general, if the controller is based on an Adaptec SCSI controller
	  chip from the aic777x series or the aic78xx series, this driver
	  should work. The only exception is the 7810 which is specifically
	  not supported (that's the RAID controller chip on the AAA-13x
	  cards).

	  Note that the AHA2920 SCSI host adapter is *not* supported by this
	  driver; choose "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" instead if you have
	  one of those.

	  Information on the configuration options for this controller can be
	  found by checking the help file for each of the available
	  configuration options. You should read
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/aic7xxx_old.txt> at a minimum before
	  contacting the maintainer with any questions.  The SCSI-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, can also
	  be of great help.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called aic7xxx_old.

	help
	This driver supports all of Adaptec's Ultra 320 PCI-X
	based SCSI controllers.

config AIC79XX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE
	int "Maximum number of TCQ commands per device"
	depends on SCSI_AIC79XX
	default "32"
	---help---
	Specify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI
	device when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.

	This is an upper bound value for the number of tagged transactions
	to be used for any device.  The aic7xxx driver will automatically
	vary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a
	fixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum
	and display a console message indicating this value.

	Due to resource allocation issues in the Linux SCSI mid-layer, using
	a high number of commands per device may result in memory allocation
	failures when many devices are attached to the system.  For this reason,
	the default is set to 32.  Higher values may result in higher performance
	on some devices.  The upper bound is 253.  0 disables tagged queueing.

	Per device tag depth can be controlled via the kernel command line
	"tag_info" option.  See Documentation/scsi/aic79xx.txt for details.

config IBMMCA_SCSI_ORDER_STANDARD
	bool "Standard SCSI-order"

	---help---
	  In the PC-world and in most modern SCSI-BIOS-setups, SCSI-hard disks
	  are assigned to the drive letters, starting with the lowest SCSI-id
	  (physical number -- pun) to be drive C:, as seen from DOS and
	  similar operating systems. When looking into papers describing the
	  ANSI-SCSI-standard, this assignment of drives appears to be wrong.
	  The SCSI-standard follows a hardware-hierarchy which says that id 7
	  has the highest priority and id 0 the lowest. Therefore, the host
	  adapters are still today everywhere placed as SCSI-id 7 by default.
	  In the SCSI-standard, the drive letters express the priority of the
	  disk. C: should be the hard disk, or a partition on it, with the
	  highest priority. This must therefore be the disk with the highest
	  SCSI-id (e.g. 6) and not the one with the lowest! IBM-BIOS kept the
	  original definition of the SCSI-standard as also industrial- and
	  process-control-machines, like VME-CPUs running under realtime-OSes
	  (e.g. LynxOS, OS9) do.

	  If you like to run Linux on your MCA-machine with the same
	  assignment of hard disks as seen from e.g. DOS or OS/2 on your
	  machine, which is in addition conformant to the SCSI-standard, you
	  must say Y here. This is also necessary for MCA-Linux users who want
	  to keep downward compatibility to older releases of the
	  IBM-MCA-SCSI-driver (older than driver-release 2.00 and older than
	  June 1997).

	  If you like to have the lowest SCSI-id assigned as drive C:, as
	  modern SCSI-BIOSes do, which does not conform to the standard, but
	  is widespread and common in the PC-world of today, you must say N
	  here. If unsure, say Y.

config IBMMCA_SCSI_DEV_RESET

	  However, some devices exist, like special-control-devices,
	  SCSI-CNC-machines, SCSI-printer or scanners of older type, that do
	  not reset when switched on. If you say Y here, each device connected
	  to your SCSI-bus will be issued a reset-command after it has been
	  probed, while the kernel is booting. This may cause problems with
	  more modern devices, like hard disks, which do not appreciate these

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS
	int "default tagged command queue depth"

	---help---
	  "Tagged command queuing" is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves
	  performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a
	  device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet.
	  Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations
	  (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI
	  devices don't implement this properly; if you want to disable this
	  feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).

	  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks.
	  This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the
	  'tags' option as follows (example):
	  'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to
	  4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0
	  and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.

	  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use

	  command queue depth.

	  There is no safe option other than using good SCSI devices.

	  Modern hard disks are able to support 64 tags and even more, but
	  do not seem to be faster when more than 32 tags are being used.

	  So, the normal answer here is to go with the default value 32 unless
	  you are using very large hard disks with large cache (>= 1 MB) that
	  are able to take advantage of more than 32 tagged commands.

	  There is no safe option and the default answer is recommended.

	---help---
	  The SCSI Parallel Interface-2 Standard defines 5 classes of transfer
	  rates: FAST-5, FAST-10, FAST-20, FAST-40 and FAST-80.  The numbers
	  are respectively the maximum data transfer rates in mega-transfers
	  per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is
	  able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a
	  total rate of 40 MB/s.

	  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data
	  transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify
	  a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI
	  controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer.
	  Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the
	  value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM,
	  since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It
	  also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows
	  (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate
	  for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per
	  second).

	  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to
	  select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum
	  value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with
	  your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.

	  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right
	  terminations and SCSI conformant devices.

	  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel
	  ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected

	  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP.  It serves
	  the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (and other
	  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
	  otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these
	  days support PPP rather than SLIP.

	  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
	  in the PPP-HOWTO, available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have
	  the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
	  The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.

	  There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for
	  asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and
	  synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for
	  example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other
	  asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to
	  the next option, "PPP support for async serial ports".  For PPP over

	  Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to
	  connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some
	  other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a
	  Slip/CSlip server for other people to dial in. SLIP (Serial Line
	  Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to send Internet traffic over
	  serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables;
	  nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same
	  purpose.

	  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you
	  to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP
	  around (available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
	  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If
	  you plan to use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The
	  NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to
	  configure SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just
	  want to run term (term is a program which gives you almost full
	  Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on
	  some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
	  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>). SLIP

	  This protocol is faster than SLIP because it uses compression on the

	  on both ends. Ask your access provider if you are not sure and
	  answer Y, just in case. You will still be able to use plain SLIP. If
	  you plan to use SLiRP, the SLIP emulator (available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which

	  bit. Saying Y here adds an extra mode you can use with SLIP:
	  "slip6". In this mode, SLIP will only send normal ASCII symbols over
	  the serial device. Naturally, this has to be supported at the other
	  end of the link as well. It's good enough, for example, to run IP
	  over the async ports of a Camtec JNT Pad. If unsure, say N.

	  In order to use this driver, you will need a firmware image for it.
          You can obtain the firmware from

          initialization time, and when built-in this typically happens

	default y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with
	  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
	  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial
	  or network connection.

	  The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages

	  answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with
	  a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most
	  common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want
	  the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case
	  you should say Y to "Console on serial port", below).

	  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual
	  terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change
	  that with a kernel command line option such as "console=tty3" which
	  would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try "man

config UNIX98_PTYS

	default y
	---help---
	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two

	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

	  with major number 10 and minor number 144 using mknod ("man mknod"),
	  you get read and write access to the extra bytes of non-volatile
	  memory in the real time clock (RTC), which is contained in every PC
	  and most Ataris.  The actual number of bytes varies, depending on the
	  nvram in the system, but is usually 114 (128-14 for the RTC).

	  This memory is conventionally called "CMOS RAM" on PCs and "NVRAM"
	  on Ataris. /dev/nvram may be used to view settings there, or to
	  change them (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently
	  save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over
	  power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note
	  however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you
	  should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list
	  for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

	  On Atari machines, /dev/nvram is always configured and does not need
	  to be selected.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  The "Serial Peripheral Interface" is a low level synchronous

	  SPI is widely used by microcontrollers to talk with sensors,

	  chips, analog to digital (and d-to-a) converters, and more.
	  MMC and SD cards can be accessed using SPI protocol; and for

	  SPI is one of a family of similar protocols using a four wire

	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to

	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read
	  <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.txt> in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from

	---help---
	  AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) is a bus system mainly used to
	  connect graphics cards to the rest of the system.

	  If you have an AGP system and you say Y here, it will be possible to
	  use the AGP features of your 3D rendering video card. This code acts
	  as a sort of "AGP driver" for the motherboard's chipset.

	  If you need more texture memory than you can get with the AGP GART
	  (theoretically up to 256 MB, but in practice usually 64 or 128 MB
	  due to kernel allocation issues), you could use PCI accesses
	  and have up to a couple gigs of texture space.

	  Note that this is the only means to have X/GLX use
	  write-combining with MTRR support on the AGP bus. Without it, OpenGL
	  direct rendering will be a lot slower but still faster than PIO.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called agpgart.

	  You should say Y here if you want to use GLX or DRI.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  The M1541 chipset can do AGP 1x and 2x, but note that there is an

	  When kernel modesetting is enabled the IOCTL of radeon/drm
	  driver are considered as invalid and an error message is printed

menuconfig FB
	tristate "Support for frame buffer devices"
	---help---
	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
	  only way to use the graphics hardware.

	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.munted.org.uk/programming/Framebuffer-HOWTO-1.3.html> for more
	  information.

	  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
	  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

	  If you say Y, then the VESA standard, Generalized Timing Formula

	  per video mode.  Since the GTF allows nondiscrete timings 
          (nondiscrete being a range of values as opposed to discrete being a
          set of values), you'll be able to use any combination of horizontal 
	  and vertical resolutions, and vertical refresh rates without having
	  to specify your own timing parameters.  This is especially useful
	  to maximize the performance of an aging display, or if you just 
          have a display with nonstandard dimensions. A VESA compliant 
	  monitor is recommended, but can still work with non-compliant ones.

	  If you don't have a sound card in your computer, you can include a

	  You can compile this as a module which will be called snd-pcsp.

	  WARNING: if you already have a soundcard, enabling this
	  driver may lead to a problem. Namely, it may get loaded
	  before the other sound driver of yours, making the
	  pc-speaker a default sound device. Which is likely not
	  what you want. To make this driver play nicely with other
	  sound driver, you can add this into your /etc/modprobe.conf:
	  options snd-pcsp index=2

	  You don't need this driver if you only want your pc-speaker to beep.
	  You don't need this driver if you have a tablet piezo beeper
	  in your PC instead of the real speaker.

	  In this case, the time-out is set to 10 seconds; setting
	  the time-out to 1 second (the minimum activation value)
	  isn't recommended because many applications try to reopen

	  Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification for a serial bus
	  subsystem which offers higher speeds and more features than the
	  traditional PC serial port.  The bus supplies power to peripherals
	  and allows for hot swapping.  Up to 127 USB peripherals can be
	  connected to a single USB host in a tree structure.
	  
	  The USB host is the root of the tree, the peripherals are the
	  leaves and the inner nodes are special USB devices called hubs.
	  Most PCs now have USB host ports, used to connect peripherals
	  such as scanners, keyboards, mice, modems, cameras, disks,
	  flash memory, network links, and printers to the PC.

	  Say Y here if your computer has a host-side USB port and you want
	  to use USB devices.  You then need to say Y to at least one of the
	  Host Controller Driver (HCD) options below.  Choose a USB 1.1
	  controller, such as "UHCI HCD support" or "OHCI HCD support",
	  and "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support" except for older systems that
	  do not have USB 2.0 support.  It doesn't normally hurt to select
	  them all if you are not certain.

	  If your system has a device-side USB port, used in the peripheral
	  side of the USB protocol, see the "USB Gadget" framework instead.

	  After choosing your HCD, then select drivers for the USB peripherals
	  you'll be using.  You may want to check out the information provided
	  in <file:Documentation/usb/> and especially the links given in
	  <file:Documentation/usb/usb-help.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbcore.

config USB_DEVICEFS
	bool "USB device filesystem (DEPRECATED)"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and to "/proc file system support" in the "File
	  systems" section, above), you will get a file /proc/bus/usb/devices
	  which lists the devices currently connected to your USB bus or
	  busses, and for every connected device a file named
	  "/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy", where xxx is the bus number and yyy the
	  device number; the latter files can be used by user space programs
	  to talk directly to the device. These files are "virtual", meaning
	  they are generated on the fly and not stored on the hard drive.

	  You may need to mount the usbfs file system to see the files, use
	  mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

	  For the format of the various /proc/bus/usb/ files, please read
	  <file:Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt>.

	  Modern Linux systems do not use this.

	  Usbfs entries are files and not character devices; usbfs can't
	  handle Access Control Lists (ACL) which are the default way to
	  grant access to USB devices for untrusted users of a desktop
	  system.

	  The usbfs functionality is replaced by real device-nodes managed by
	  udev.  These nodes lived in /dev/bus/usb and are used by libusb.

config USB_DEVICE_CLASS
	bool "USB device class-devices (DEPRECATED)"
	depends on USB
	default y
	---help---
	  Userspace access to USB devices is granted by device-nodes exported
	  directly from the usbdev in sysfs. Old versions of the driver
	  core and udev needed additional class devices to export device nodes.

	  These additional devices are difficult to handle in userspace, if
	  information about USB interfaces must be available. One device
	  contains the device node, the other device contains the interface
	  data. Both devices are at the same level in sysfs (siblings) and one
	  can't access the other. The device node created directly by the
	  usb device is the parent device of the interface and therefore
	  easily accessible from the interface event.

	  This option provides backward compatibility for libusb device
	  nodes (lsusb) when usbfs is not used, and the following udev rule
	  doesn't exist:
	    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", \

config USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS

	  If you say Y here, the USB subsystem will use dynamic minor
	  allocation for any device that uses the USB major number.
	  This means that you can have more than 16 of a single type

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.

config USB_SUSPEND

	  individual USB peripherals (see
	  Documentation/usb/power-management.txt for more details).

	  Also, USB "remote wakeup" signaling is supported, whereby some
	  USB devices (like keyboards and network adapters) can wake up

config USB_OTG_WHITELIST

	  If you say Y here, the "otg_whitelist.h" file will be used as a

	  rejected during enumeration.  This behavior is required by the
	  USB OTG specification for all devices not on your product's
	  "Targeted Peripherals List".  "Embedded Hosts" are likewise
	  allowed to support only a limited number of peripherals.

	  Otherwise, peripherals not listed there will only generate a

	  The U132 adapter is a USB to CardBus adapter specifically designed

	  are the Orange Mobile 3G Option GlobeTrotter Fusion card. The U132
	  adapter will *NOT* work with PC cards that do not contain an OHCI
	  controller.

	  For those PC cards that contain multiple OHCI controllers only the
	  first one is used.

	  The driver consists of two modules, the "ftdi-elan" module is a
	  USB client driver that interfaces to the FTDI chip within ELAN's
	  USB-to-PCMCIA adapter, and this "u132-hcd" module is a USB host
	  controller driver that talks to the OHCI controller within the
	  CardBus cards that are inserted in the U132 adapter.

	  This driver has been tested with a CardBus OHCI USB adapter, and

menuconfig USB_GADGET
	tristate "USB Gadget Support"
	help
	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
	   don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

	   For more information, see <http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget> and

	   Avoid enabling these messages, even if you're actively
	   debugging such a driver.  Many drivers will emit so many
	   messages that the driver timings are affected, which will

	   Enter the maximum power your device draws through USB, in
	   milliAmperes.  The permitted range of values is 2 - 500 mA;

	default 2
	help
	   Usually 2 buffers are enough to establish a good buffering
	   pipeline. The number may be increased in order to compensate
	   for a bursty VFS behaviour. For instance there may be CPU wake up
	   latencies that makes the VFS to appear bursty in a system with
	   an CPU on-demand governor. Especially if DMA is doing IO to
	   offload the CPU. In this case the CPU will go into power
	   save often and spin up occasionally to move data within VFS.
	   If selecting USB_GADGET_DEBUG_FILES this value may be set by
	   a module parameter as well.
	   If unsure, say 2.

	  A Linux "Gadget Driver" talks to the USB Peripheral Controller
	  driver through the abstract "gadget" API.  Some other operating
	  systems call these "client" drivers, of which "class drivers"
	  are a subset (implementing a USB device class specification).
	  A gadget driver implements one or more USB functions using
	  the peripheral hardware.

	  Gadget drivers are hardware-neutral, or "platform independent",
	  except that they sometimes must understand quirks or limitations
	  of the particular controllers they work with.  For example, when
	  a controller doesn't support alternate configurations or provide
	  enough of the right types of endpoints, the gadget driver might
	  not be able work with that controller, or might need to implement
	  a less common variant of a device class protocol.

	  USB "gadget drivers" can be written.

	  Make this be the first driver you try using on top of any new
	  USB peripheral controller driver.  Then you can use host-side
	  test software, like the "usbtest" driver, to put your hardware
	  and its driver through a basic set of functional tests.

	  Gadget Zero also works with the host-side "usb-skeleton" driver,
	  and with many kinds of host-side test software.  You may need
	  to tweak product and vendor IDs before host software knows about
	  this device, and arrange to select an appropriate configuration.

	  This driver was formerly known as ibm-acpi.

	  Extra functionality will be available if the rfkill (CONFIG_RFKILL)

	  Enables monitoring of the built-in console audio output control

	  Optionally, the driver will also allow software control (the
	  ALSA mixer will be made read-write).  Please refer to the driver

config THINKPAD_ACPI_UNSAFE_LEDS
	bool "Allow control of important LEDs (unsafe)"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI

	  Overriding LED state on ThinkPads can mask important
	  firmware alerts (like critical battery condition), or misled
	  the user into damaging the hardware (undocking or ejecting
	  the bay while buses are still active), etc.

	  LED control on the ThinkPad is write-only (with very few
	  exceptions on very ancient models), which makes it
	  impossible to know beforehand if important information will
	  be lost when one changes LED state.

	  Users that know what they are doing can enable this option
	  and the driver will allow control of every LED, including
	  the ones on the dock stations.

	  Never enable this option on a distribution kernel.

	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to provide an interface to control
	  the various video output ports.

	  This feature often won't work well, depending on ThinkPad model,
	  display state, video output devices in use, whether there is a X
	  server running, phase of the moon, and the current mood of
	  Schroedinger's cat.  If you can use X.org's RandR to control
	  your ThinkPad's video output ports instead of this feature,
	  don't think twice: do it and say N here to save memory and avoid
	  bad interactions with X.org.

	  NOTE: access to this feature is limited to processes with the
	  CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, to avoid local DoS issues in platforms
	  where it interacts badly with X.org.

	  If you are not sure, say Y here but do try to check if you could
	  be using X.org RandR instead.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_HOTKEY_POLL
	bool "Support NVRAM polling for hot keys"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Some thinkpad models benefit from NVRAM polling to detect a few of
	  the hot key press events.  If you know your ThinkPad model does not
	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.

	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.

	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access
	  IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute,
	  Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.  The driver enables polling only if

	  This driver provides support for extra features of ACPI-compatible
	  ASUS laptops. As some of Medion laptops are made by ASUS, it may also
	  support some Medion laptops (such as 9675 for example).  It makes all
	  the extra buttons generate standard ACPI events that go through
	  /proc/acpi/events, and (on some models) adds support for changing the
	  display brightness and output, switching the LCD backlight on and off,
	  and most importantly, allows you to blink those fancy LEDs intended
	  for reporting mail and wireless status.

	  Note: display switching code is currently considered EXPERIMENTAL,
	  toying with these values may even lock your machine.

	  All settings are changed via /proc/acpi/asus directory entries. Owner
	  and group for these entries can be set with asus_uid and asus_gid
	  parameters.

	  Each device may have its own governor and policy. Devfreq can
	  reevaluate the device state periodically and/or based on the
	  notification to "nb", a notifier block, of devfreq.

	  Like some CPUs with CPUfreq, a device may have multiple clocks.
	  However, because the clock frequencies of a single device are

	  is attached to a single device and returns a "representative"
	  clock frequency of the device, which is also attached

	  given to devfreq.

	  When OPP is used with the devfreq device, it is recommended to

	  This is the journalling version of the Second extended file system

	  (method to organize files on a storage device) for hard disks.

	  The journalling code included in this driver means you do not have
	  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
	  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
	  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
	  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

	  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
	  of ext3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
	  between using the ext3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
	  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
	  system.

	  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
	  behavior of ext3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
	  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on ext3
	  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using

	  While we cannot guarantee that it will not damage any data, we have

	The sysfs filesystem is a virtual filesystem that the kernel uses to

	relationships to one another.

	Users can use sysfs to ascertain useful information about the running
	kernel, such as the devices the kernel has discovered on each bus and
	which driver each is bound to. sysfs can also be used to tune devices
	and other kernel subsystems.

	Some system agents rely on the information in sysfs to operate.
	/sbin/hotplug uses device and object attributes in sysfs to assist in
	delegating policy decisions, like persistently naming devices.

	sysfs is currently used by the block subsystem to mount the root
	partition.  If sysfs is disabled you must specify the boot device on

	  Saying N here will give you these filenames in uppercase.

	  This is only a cosmetic option since the OS2/LONG namespace is case
	  insensitive. The only major reason for this option is backward
	  compatibility when moving from DOS to OS2/LONG namespace support.
	  Long filenames (created by Win95) will not be affected.

	  This option does not solve the problem that filenames appear

	  replication, security model for authentication and encryption,
	  persistent client caches and write back caching.

	  If you say Y here, your Linux box will be able to act as a Coda

	  most likely result in an oops.
	  In the code, functions and variables are annotated with
	  __init, __devinit, etc. (see the full list in include/linux/init.h),
	  which results in the code/data being placed in specific sections.
	  The section mismatch analysis is always performed after a full
	  kernel build, and enabling this option causes the following
	  additional steps to occur:
	  - Add the option -fno-inline-functions-called-once to gcc commands.
	    When inlining a function annotated with __init in a non-init
	    function, we would lose the section information and thus
	    the analysis would not catch the illegal reference.
	    This option tells gcc to inline less (but it does result in
	    a larger kernel).
	  - Run the section mismatch analysis for each module/built-in.o file.
	    When we run the section mismatch analysis on vmlinux.o, we
	    lose valueble information about where the mismatch was
	    introduced.
	    Running the analysis for each module/built-in.o file
	    tells where the mismatch happens much closer to the
	    source. The drawback is that the same mismatch is
	    reported at least twice.
	  - Enable verbose reporting from modpost in order to help resolve

	 This feature enables the kernel to prove that all locking

	 not yet triggered) combination of observed locking
	 sequences (on an arbitrary number of CPUs, running an
	 arbitrary number of tasks and interrupt contexts) cause a
	 deadlock.

	 In short, this feature enables the kernel to report locking
	 related deadlocks before they actually occur.

	 The proof does not depend on how hard and complex a
	 deadlock scenario would be to trigger: how many
	 participant CPUs, tasks and irq-contexts would be needed
	 for it to trigger. The proof also does not depend on
	 timing: if a race and a resulting deadlock is possible
	 theoretically (no matter how unlikely the race scenario
	 is), it will be proven so and will immediately be
	 reported by the kernel (once the event is observed that
	 makes the deadlock theoretically possible).

	 If a deadlock is impossible (i.e. the locking rules, as
	 observed by the kernel, are mathematically correct), the
	 kernel reports nothing.

	 NOTE: this feature can also be enabled for rwlocks, mutexes
	 and rwsems - in which case all dependencies between these
	 different locking variants are observed and mapped too, and

	help
	  If you want to debug problems which hang or crash the kernel early
	  on boot and the crashing machine has a FireWire port, you can use
	  this feature to remotely access the memory of the crashed machine
	  over FireWire. This employs remote DMA as part of the OHCI1394
	  specification which is now the standard for FireWire controllers.

	  With remote DMA, you can monitor the printk buffer remotely using
	  firescope and access all memory below 4GB using fireproxy from gdb.
	  Even controlling a kernel debugger is possible using remote DMA.

	  Usage:

	  If ohci1394_dma=early is used as boot parameter, it will initialize
	  all OHCI1394 controllers which are found in the PCI config space.

	  As all changes to the FireWire bus such as enabling and disabling
	  devices cause a bus reset and thereby disable remote DMA for all
	  devices, be sure to have the cable plugged and FireWire enabled on
	  the debugging host before booting the debug target for debugging.

	  This code (~1k) is freed after boot. By then, the firewire stack
	  in charge of the OHCI-1394 controllers should be used instead.

	  Compiles debug level messages into the kernel, which would not
	  otherwise be available at runtime. These messages can then be
	  enabled/disabled based on various levels of scope - per source file,
	  function, module, format string, and line number. This mechanism
	  implicitly enables all pr_debug() and dev_dbg() calls. The impact of
	  this compile option is a larger kernel text size of about 2%.

	  Usage:

	  Dynamic debugging is controlled via the 'dynamic_debug/control' file,
	  which is contained in the 'debugfs' filesystem. Thus, the debugfs
	  filesystem must first be mounted before making use of this feature.
	  We refer the control file as: <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control. This
	  file contains a list of the debug statements that can be enabled. The
	  format for each line of the file is:

		filename:lineno [module]function flags format

	  filename : source file of the debug statement
	  lineno : line number of the debug statement
	  module : module that contains the debug statement
	  function : function that contains the debug statement
          flags : 'p' means the line is turned 'on' for printing
          format : the format used for the debug statement

	  From a live system:

		nullarbor:~ # cat <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control
		# filename:lineno [module]function flags format
		fs/aio.c:222 [aio]__put_ioctx - "__put_ioctx:\040freeing\040%p\012"
		fs/aio.c:248 [aio]ioctx_alloc - "ENOMEM:\040nr_events\040too\040high\012"
		fs/aio.c:1770 [aio]sys_io_cancel - "calling\040cancel\012"

	  Example usage:

		// enable the message at line 1603 of file svcsock.c
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'file svcsock.c line 1603 +p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

		// enable all the messages in file svcsock.c
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'file svcsock.c +p' >
