	  Some of the various things that Linux supports (such as network
	  drivers, file systems, network protocols, etc.) can be in a state
	  of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
	  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
	  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
	  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
	  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
	  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
	  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
	  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
	  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
	  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
	  (before submitting bug reports, please read the documents
	  <file:README>, <file:MAINTAINERS>, <file:REPORTING-BUGS>,
	  <file:Documentation/BUG-HUNTING>, and
	  <file:Documentation/oops-tracing.txt> in the kernel source).

	  This option will also make obsoleted drivers available. These are
	  drivers that have been replaced by something else, and/or are

	  If you say Y here, you will need to run "make

	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and

	  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
	  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
	  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able

	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
	  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then

	  filesystem wishes to access a page in a file on disk, it first
	  checks cleancache to see if it already contains it; if it does,
	  the page is copied into the kernel and a disk access is avoided.
	  When a transcendent memory driver is available (such as zcache or
	  Xen transcendent memory), a significant I/O reduction
	  may be achieved.  When none is available, all cleancache calls
	  are reduced to a single pointer-compare-against-NULL resulting
	  in a negligible performance hit.

	  Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
	  The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even
	  when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any
	  other computer.
	  
	  If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you
	  should consider updating your networking tools too because changes
	  in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are
	  contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number
	  of which are given in <file:Documentation/Changes>.

	  For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly
	  recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from

config IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER

	---help---
	  If you intend to run your Linux box mostly as a router, i.e. as a
	  computer that forwards and redistributes network packets, say Y; you
	  will then be presented with several options that allow more precise
	  control about the routing process.

	  The answer to this question won't directly affect the kernel:
	  answering N will just cause the configurator to skip all the
	  questions about advanced routing.

	  Note that your box can only act as a router if you enable IP
	  forwarding in your kernel; you can do that by saying Y to "/proc
	  file system support" and "Sysctl support" below and executing the
	  line

	  echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

	  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

	  If you turn on IP forwarding, you should consider the rp_filter, which
	  automatically rejects incoming packets if the routing table entry
	  for their source address doesn't match the network interface they're
	  arriving on. This has security advantages because it prevents the
	  so-called IP spoofing, however it can pose problems if you use
	  asymmetric routing (packets from you to a host take a different path
	  than packets from that host to you) or if you operate a non-routing
	  host which has several IP addresses on different interfaces. To turn
	  rp_filter on use:

	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<device>/rp_filter
	   or
	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter

	  Note that some distributions enable it in startup scripts.

	  attack and requires very little work from the attacker, who can
	  operate from anywhere on the Internet.

	  SYN cookies provide protection against this type of attack. If you
	  say Y here, the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge
	  protocol known as "SYN cookies" to enable legitimate users to
	  continue to connect, even when your machine is under attack. There
	  is no need for the legitimate users to change their TCP/IP software;
	  SYN cookies work transparently to them. For technical information
	  about SYN cookies, check out <http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html>.

	  If you are SYN flooded, the source address reported by the kernel is
	  likely to have been forged by the attacker; it is only reported as
	  an aid in tracing the packets to their actual source and should not
	  be taken as absolute truth.

	  SYN cookies may prevent correct error reporting on clients when the

menuconfig NETFILTER
	bool "Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)"
	---help---
	  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
	  that pass through your Linux box.

	  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
	  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
	  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
	  filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
	  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
	  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
	  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
	  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
	  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
	  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
	  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
	  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
	  you say Y here.

	  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
	  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
	  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
	  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
	  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
	  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
	  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
	  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
	  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
	  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
	  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
	  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
	  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
	  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
	  called NAT (Network Address Translation).

	  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
	  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
	  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
	  typically a caching proxy server.

	  Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using
	  a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables "see"
	  the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet
	  protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter
	  configuration).

	  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
	  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
	  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
	  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
	  these packages.

	The target allows you to create rules in the "mangle" table which alter
	the netfilter mark (nfmark) field associated with the packet.

	Prior to routing, the nfmark can influence the routing method (see

	  you could have an LED which lights up for a minute or two every time
	  somebody connects to your machine via SSH.

	  You will need support for the "led" class to make this work.

	  To create an LED trigger for incoming SSH traffic:
	    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j LED --led-trigger-id ssh --led-delay 1000

	        2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
	        3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

	  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall

	  The IPVS connection hash table uses the chaining scheme to handle

	  reduce conflicts when there are hundreds of thousands of connections
	  in the hash table.

	  Note the table size must be power of 2. The table size will be the
	  value of 2 to the your input number power. The number to choose is
	  from 8 to 20, the default number is 12, which means the table size
	  is 4096. Don't input the number too small, otherwise you will lose
	  performance on it. You can adapt the table size yourself, according
	  to your virtual server application. It is good to set the table size
	  not far less than the number of connections per second multiplying
	  average lasting time of connection in the table.  For example, your
	  virtual server gets 200 connections per second, the connection lasts
	  for 200 seconds in average in the connection table, the table size
	  should be not far less than 200x200, it is good to set the table
	  size 32768 (2**15).

	  Another note that each connection occupies 128 bytes effectively and
	  each hash entry uses 8 bytes, so you can estimate how much memory is
	  needed for your box.

	  You can overwrite this number setting conn_tab_bits module parameter
	  or by appending ip_vs.conn_tab_bits=? to the kernel command line
	  if IP VS was compiled built-in.

	  L2TP facilitates the tunneling of packets across an

	  possible to both end-users and applications.

	  L2TP is often used to tunnel PPP traffic over IP
	  tunnels. One IP tunnel may carry thousands of individual PPP
	  connections. L2TP is also used as a VPN protocol, popular
	  with home workers to connect to their offices.

	  L2TPv3 allows other protocols as well as PPP to be carried
	  over L2TP tunnels. L2TPv3 is defined in RFC 3931
	  <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3931.txt>.

	  The kernel component handles only L2TP data packets: a
	  userland daemon handles L2TP the control protocol (tunnel
	  and session setup). One such daemon is OpenL2TP
	  (http://openl2tp.org/).

	  The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a dynamic
	  mechanism for tunneling Layer 2 (L2) "circuits" across a
	  packet-oriented data network (e.g., over IP).  L2TP, as
	  originally defined in RFC 2661, is a standard method for
	  tunneling Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661] sessions.
	  L2TP has since been adopted for tunneling a number of other
	  L2 protocols, including ATM, Frame Relay, HDLC and even raw
	  ethernet frames.

	  If you are connecting to L2TPv3 equipment, or you want to
	  tunnel raw ethernet frames using L2TP, say Y here. If
	  unsure, say N.

	  driver provides a new L2TPIP socket family with which
	  userspace L2TPv3 daemons may create L2TP/IP tunnel sockets
	  when UDP encapsulation is not required. When L2TP is carried
	  in IP packets, it used IP protocol number 115, so this port
	  must be enabled in firewalls.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called l2tp_ip.

	  used as a control protocol and for data encapsulation to set
	  up Pseudowires for transporting layer 2 Packet Data Units
	  across an IP network [RFC3931].

	  This driver provides an ethernet virtual interface for each
	  L2TP ethernet pseudowire instance. Standard Linux tools may
	  be used to assign an IP address to the local virtual

	  The full internal IPX network enables you to allocate sockets on

	  evaluating the field sipx_node of the socket address given to the

	  to 0 when binding a socket on the primary network. In this case the
	  socket is assigned the default node that has been given to the
	  kernel when the internal network was created. By enabling the full
	  internal IPX network the cross-forwarding of packets targeted at
	  'special' sockets to sockets listening on the primary network is
	  disabled. This might break existing applications, especially RIP/SAP

	  traffic.

	  Currently, this driver supports Ottawa PI/PI2, Paccomm/Gracilis
	  PackeTwin, and S5SCC/DMA boards. They are detected automatically.
	  If you have one of these cards, say Y here and read the AX25-HOWTO,

	  If you want to exchange bits of data (vCal, vCard) with a PDA, you

	depends on IRDA
	---help---
	  Say Y here is you want IrLAP to send fast RR (Receive Ready) frames
	  when acting as a primary station.
	  Disabling this option will make latency over IrDA very bad. Enabling
	  this option will make the IrDA stack send more packet than strictly
	  necessary, thus reduce your battery life (but not that much).

	  Fast RR will make IrLAP send out a RR frame immediately when
	  receiving a frame if its own transmit queue is currently empty. This
	  will give a lot of speed improvement when receiving much data since
	  the secondary station will not have to wait the max. turn around
	  time (usually 500ms) before it is allowed to transmit the next time.
	  If the transmit queue of the secondary is also empty, the primary will
	  start backing-off before sending another RR frame, waiting longer
	  each time until the back-off reaches the max. turn around time.
	  This back-off increase in controlled via

config MMC_BLOCK
	tristate "MMC block device driver"
	depends on BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the MMC block device driver support.
	  This provides a block device driver, which you can use to
	  mount the filesystem. Almost everyone wishing MMC support
	  should say Y or M here.

config MMC_BLOCK_MINORS
	int "Number of minors per block device"
	depends on MMC_BLOCK
	range 4 256
	default 8
	help
	  Number of minors per block device. One is needed for every
	  partition on the disk (plus one for the whole disk).

	  Number of total MMC minors available is 256, so your number
	  of supported block devices will be limited to 256 divided
	  by this number.

	  Default is 8 to be backwards compatible with previous
	  hardwired device numbering.

	  If unsure, say 8 here.

config MMC_BLOCK_BOUNCE
	bool "Use bounce buffer for simple hosts"
	depends on MMC_BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  SD/MMC is a high latency protocol where it is crucial to
	  send large requests in order to get high performance. Many
	  controllers, however, are restricted to continuous memory
	  (i.e. they can't do scatter-gather), something the kernel
	  rarely can provide.

	  Say Y here to help these restricted hosts by bouncing
	  requests back and forth from a large buffer. You will get
	  a big performance gain at the cost of up to 64 KiB of
	  physical memory.

	  If unsure, say Y here.

config SDIO_UART
	tristate "SDIO UART/GPS class support"
	help
	  SDIO function driver for SDIO cards that implements the UART
	  class, as well as the GPS class which appears like a UART.

config MMC_TEST
	tristate "MMC host test driver"
	help
	  Development driver that performs a series of reads and writes
	  to a memory card in order to expose certain well known bugs
	  in host controllers. The tests are executed by writing to the
	  "test" file in debugfs under each card. Note that whatever is
	  on your card will be overwritten by these tests.

	  This driver is only of interest to those developing or
	  testing a host driver. Most people should say N here.

	  The "Serial Peripheral Interface" is a low level synchronous
	  protocol.  Chips that support SPI can have data transfer rates
	  up to several tens of Mbit/sec.  Chips are addressed with a
	  controller and a chipselect.  Most SPI slaves don't support
	  dynamic device discovery; some are even write-only or read-only.

	  SPI is widely used by microcontrollers to talk with sensors,
	  eeprom and flash memory, codecs and various other controller
	  chips, analog to digital (and d-to-a) converters, and more.
	  MMC and SD cards can be accessed using SPI protocol; and for
	  DataFlash cards used in MMC sockets, SPI must always be used.

	  SPI is one of a family of similar protocols using a four wire
	  interface (select, clock, data in, data out) including Microwire
	  (half duplex), SSP, SSI, and PSP.  This driver framework should
	  work with most such devices and controllers.

	  Before the switch to the netlink-based uevent source, this was

	  usually pointed to a shell script at /sbin/hotplug.
	  This should not be used today, because usual systems create

	  that it creates a high system load, or on smaller systems
	  it is known to create out-of-memory situations during bootup.

	  To disable user space helper program execution at early boot

	  Userspace can modify the filesystem content as needed, add

	  In very limited environments, it may provide a sufficient
	  functional /dev without any further help. It also allows simple

	  The kernel source tree includes a number of firmware 'blobs'

	  that they can be loaded by userspace helpers on request.

	  Enabling this option will build each required firmware blob
	  into the kernel directly, where request_firmware() will find
	  them without having to call out to userspace. This may be
	  useful if your root file system requires a device that uses
	  such firmware and do not wish to use an initrd.

	  This single option controls the inclusion of firmware for

	  use an initrd).

	  This option is a string and takes the (space-separated) names of the
	  firmware files -- the same names that appear in MODULE_FIRMWARE()
	  and request_firmware() in the source. These files should exist under
	  the directory specified by the EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR option, which is
	  by default the firmware subdirectory of the kernel source tree.

	  For example, you might set CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="usb8388.bin", copy
	  the usb8388.bin file into the firmware directory, and build the kernel.
	  Then any request_firmware("usb8388.bin") will be satisfied internally
	  without needing to call out to userspace.

	  WARNING: If you include additional firmware files into your binary
	  kernel image that are not available under the terms of the GPL,

	  erased. Each Protection Register can be accessed multiple times to
	  program individual bits, as long as the register remains unlocked.

	  Each Protection Register has an associated Lock Register bit. When a
	  Lock Register bit is programmed, the associated Protection Register
	  can only be read; it can no longer be programmed. Additionally,
	  because the Lock Register bits themselves are OTP, when programmed,
	  Lock Register bits cannot be erased. Therefore, when a Protection
	  Register is locked, it cannot be unlocked.

	  Linux uses the PNPBIOS as defined in "Plug and Play BIOS

	  conflicts between mainboard devices and other bus devices.

config BLK_DEV_LOOP

	---help---
	  Saying Y here will allow you to use a regular file as a block
	  device; you can then create a file system on that block device and
	  mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard
	  drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices
	  are block special device files with major number 7 and typically
	  called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.

	  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before
	  burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first
	  writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid
	  the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete
	  root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device
	  driver.

	  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility, found in the
	  util-linux package, see
	  <ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/>.

	  The loop device driver can also be used to "hide" a file system in
	  a disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption
	  (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low
	  bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides
	  on a remote file server.

	  There are several ways of encrypting disks. Some of these require
	  kernel patches. The vanilla kernel offers the cryptoloop option
	  and a Device Mapper target (which is superior, as it supports all
	  file systems). If you want to use the cryptoloop, say Y to both
	  LOOP and CRYPTOLOOP, and make sure you have a recent (version 2.12
	  or later) version of util-linux. Additionally, be aware that
	  the cryptoloop is not safe for storing journaled filesystems.

	  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback
	  device used for network connections from the machine to itself.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called loop.

	  The historic default is 8. If a late 2011 version of losetup(8)
	  is used, it can be set to 0, since needed loop devices can be
	  dynamically allocated with the /dev/loop-control interface.

	  ext3 or Reiserfs. Please use the Device Mapper crypto module
	  instead, which can be configured to be on-disk compatible with the

	help

	  NOTE: In order to authenticate connections you have to select
	  CRYPTO_HMAC and a hash function as well.

	  DRBD is a shared-nothing, synchronously replicated block device. It
	  is designed to serve as a building block for high availability
	  clusters and in this context, is a "drop-in" replacement for shared
	  storage. Simplistically, you could see it as a network RAID 1.

	  Each minor device has a role, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'.
	  On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to
	  run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to
	  the local 'lower level block device' and, across the network, to the
	  node with the device in 'secondary' state.  The secondary device
	  simply writes the data to its lower level block device.

	  DRBD can also be used in dual-Primary mode (device writable on both
	  nodes), which means it can exhibit shared disk semantics in a
	  shared-nothing cluster.  Needless to say, on top of dual-Primary
	  DRBD utilizing a cluster file system is necessary to maintain for
	  cache coherency.

	  For automatic failover you need a cluster manager (e.g. heartbeat).

	  PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is used to create a

	  install a Linux distribution on a machine which doesn't have a
	  CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies
	  first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option
	  enabled for this to work.

	  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel
	  ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected
	  with "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink" cables which can transmit 4
	  bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on
	  bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a
	  time (mode 1); you can find the wiring of these cables in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/PLIP.txt>.  The cables can be up to
	  15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows
	  and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet
	  driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>)
	  and winsock or NCSA's telnet.

	  If you want to use PLIP, say Y and read the PLIP mini-HOWTO as well
	  as the NET-3-HOWTO, both available from

	  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP.  It serves
	  the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (and other
	  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
	  otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these
	  days support PPP rather than SLIP.

	  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
	  in the PPP-HOWTO, available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have
	  the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
	  The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.

	  There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for
	  asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and
	  synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for
	  example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other
	  asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to
	  the next option, "PPP support for async serial ports".  For PPP over
	  synchronous lines, you should say Y (or M) here and to "Support
	  synchronous PPP", below.

	  nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same
	  purpose.

	  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you
	  to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP
	  around (available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
	  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If
	  you plan to use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The
	  NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to
	  configure SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just

	  Just occasionally you may need to run IP over hostile serial

	  bit. Saying Y here adds an extra mode you can use with SLIP:
	  "slip6". In this mode, SLIP will only send normal ASCII symbols over
	  the serial device. Naturally, this has to be supported at the other
	  end of the link as well. It's good enough, for example, to run IP

	  In order to use this driver, you will need a firmware image for it.

	  In order to use this driver, you will need a firmware image for it.
          You can obtain the firmware from
	  <http://ipw2200.sf.net/>.  See the above referenced README.ipw2200

	default y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with
	  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
	  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial

	  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual
	  terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change
	  that with a kernel command line option such as "console=tty3" which
	  would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try "man

	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two

	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was

	  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices

	  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
	  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
	  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
	  "lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

	  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO

	  option "console=lp0" to the kernel at boot time.

	  If the printer is out of paper (or off, or unplugged, or too
	  busy..) the kernel will stall until the printer is ready again.
	  By defining CONSOLE_LP_STRICT to 0 (at your own risk) you

	  This is the journalling version of the Second extended file system

	  The journalling code included in this driver means you do not have
	  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
	  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
	  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
	  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

	  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
	  of ext3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
	  between using the ext3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
	  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
	  system.

	  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
	  behavior of ext3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
	  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on ext3
	  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using

	  the on-disk format of ext4 is not forwards compatible with
	  ext3; it is based on extent maps and it supports 48-bit
	  physical block numbers.  The ext4 filesystem also supports delayed
	  allocation, persistent preallocation, high resolution time stamps,
	  and a number of other features to improve performance and speed
	  up fsck time.  For more information, please see the web pages at
	  http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org.

	  The ext4 filesystem will support mounting an ext3
	  filesystem; while there will be some performance gains from
	  the delayed allocation and inode table readahead, the best
	  performance gains will require enabling ext4 features in the
	  filesystem, or formatting a new filesystem as an ext4
	  filesystem initially.

	  renaming is possible.  Note only non-resident files can be written to
	  so you may find that some very small files (<500 bytes or so) cannot
	  be written to.

	  While we cannot guarantee that it will not damage any data, we have
	  so far not received a single report where the driver would have
	  damaged someones data so we assume it is perfectly safe to use.

	  Note:  While write support is safe in this version (a rewrite from

	  (if larger).  This, because blocks are packed together and
	  unaligned in Squashfs, should reduce latency.

	  This, however, gives poor performance on MTD NAND devices where
	  the optimal I/O size is 4K (even though the devices can support
	  smaller block sizes).

	  Using a 4K device block size may also improve overall I/O
	  performance for some file access patterns (e.g. sequential

	  Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification for a serial bus
	  subsystem which offers higher speeds and more features than the
	  traditional PC serial port.  The bus supplies power to peripherals
	  and allows for hot swapping.  Up to 127 USB peripherals can be
	  connected to a single USB host in a tree structure.
	  
	  The USB host is the root of the tree, the peripherals are the
	  leaves and the inner nodes are special USB devices called hubs.
	  Most PCs now have USB host ports, used to connect peripherals
	  such as scanners, keyboards, mice, modems, cameras, disks,
	  flash memory, network links, and printers to the PC.

	  Say Y here if your computer has a host-side USB port and you want
	  to use USB devices.  You then need to say Y to at least one of the
	  Host Controller Driver (HCD) options below.  Choose a USB 1.1
	  controller, such as "UHCI HCD support" or "OHCI HCD support",
	  and "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support" except for older systems that
	  do not have USB 2.0 support.  It doesn't normally hurt to select
	  them all if you are not certain.

	  If your system has a device-side USB port, used in the peripheral
	  side of the USB protocol, see the "USB Gadget" framework instead.

	  After choosing your HCD, then select drivers for the USB peripherals
	  you'll be using.  You may want to check out the information provided
	  in <file:Documentation/usb/> and especially the links given in
	  <file:Documentation/usb/usb-help.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and to "/proc file system support" in the "File

	  which lists the devices currently connected to your USB bus or
	  busses, and for every connected device a file named
	  "/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy", where xxx is the bus number and yyy the
	  device number; the latter files can be used by user space programs
	  to talk directly to the device. These files are "virtual", meaning
	  they are generated on the fly and not stored on the hard drive.

	  You may need to mount the usbfs file system to see the files, use
	  mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

	  For the format of the various /proc/bus/usb/ files, please read
	  <file:Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt>.

	  Modern Linux systems do not use this.

	  Usbfs entries are files and not character devices; usbfs can't
	  handle Access Control Lists (ACL) which are the default way to
	  grant access to USB devices for untrusted users of a desktop
	  system.

	  The usbfs functionality is replaced by real device-nodes managed by
	  udev.  These nodes lived in /dev/bus/usb and are used by libusb.

config USB_DEVICE_CLASS
	bool "USB device class-devices (DEPRECATED)"
	depends on USB
	default y
	---help---
	  Userspace access to USB devices is granted by device-nodes exported
	  directly from the usbdev in sysfs. Old versions of the driver
	  core and udev needed additional class devices to export device nodes.

	  These additional devices are difficult to handle in userspace, if
	  information about USB interfaces must be available. One device
	  contains the device node, the other device contains the interface
	  data. Both devices are at the same level in sysfs (siblings) and one
	  can't access the other. The device node created directly by the
	  usb device is the parent device of the interface and therefore
	  easily accessible from the interface event.

	  This option provides backward compatibility for libusb device
	  nodes (lsusb) when usbfs is not used, and the following udev rule
	  doesn't exist:
	    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", \

config USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS
	bool "Dynamic USB minor allocation"

	  Also, USB "remote wakeup" signaling is supported, whereby some
	  USB devices (like keyboards and network adapters) can wake up

	  "Targeted Peripherals List".  "Embedded Hosts" are likewise
	  allowed to support only a limited number of peripherals.

	  Otherwise, peripherals not listed there will only generate a

	help
	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
	   don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

	  is accessible through the /dev/lcd char device (10, 156), and the
	  keypad through /dev/keypad (10, 185). Both require misc device to be

	  This is the index of the parallel port the panel is connected to. One
	  driver instance only supports one parallel port, so if your keypad

	  To ease configuration, the driver supports different configuration
	  profiles for past and recent wirings. These profiles can also be
	  used to define an approximative configuration, completed by a few
	  other options. Here are the profiles :

	    0 = custom (see further)
	    1 = 2x16 parallel LCD, old keypad
	    2 = 2x16 serial LCD (KS-0074), new keypad

	    4 = 2x16 parallel LCD (Nexcom NSA1045) with Nexcom's keypad
	    5 = 2x40 parallel LCD (old one), with old keypad

	  Custom configurations allow you to define how your display is

	---help---
	  Most LCDs use a standard controller which supports hardware lines of 40
	  characters, although sometimes only 16, 20 or 24 of them are really wired
	  to the terminal. This results in some non-visible but addressable characters,
	  and is the case for most parallel LCDs. Other LCDs, and some serial ones,
	  however, use the same line width internally as what is visible. The KS0074
	  for example, uses 16 characters per line for 16 visible characters per line.

	  This option lets you configure the value used by your LCD in 'custom' profile.
	  If you don't know, put '40' here.

config PANEL_LCD_HWIDTH

	int "Hardware LCD line width (1-64, 64 by default)"
	range 1 64

	---help---
	  Most LCDs use a single address bit to differentiate line 0 and line 1. Since
	  some of them need to be able to address 40 chars with the lower bits, they
	  often use the immediately superior power of 2, which is 64, to address the
	  next line.

	  If you don't know what your LCD uses, in doubt let 16 here for a 2x16, and

	  Valid values are :

	  This driver now supports any serial or parallel LCD wired to a parallel
	  port. But before assigning signals, the driver needs to know if it will
	  be driving a serial LCD or a parallel one. Serial LCDs only use 2 wires
	  (SDA/SCL), while parallel ones use 2 or 3 wires for the control signals

	  The section mismatch analysis checks if there are illegal

	  most likely result in an oops.
	  In the code, functions and variables are annotated with
	  __init, __devinit, etc. (see the full list in include/linux/init.h),
	  which results in the code/data being placed in specific sections.
	  The section mismatch analysis is always performed after a full
	  kernel build, and enabling this option causes the following
	  additional steps to occur:
	  - Add the option -fno-inline-functions-called-once to gcc commands.
	    When inlining a function annotated with __init in a non-init
	    function, we would lose the section information and thus
	    the analysis would not catch the illegal reference.
	    This option tells gcc to inline less (but it does result in
	    a larger kernel).
	  - Run the section mismatch analysis for each module/built-in.o file.
	    When we run the section mismatch analysis on vmlinux.o, we
	    lose valueble information about where the mismatch was
	    introduced.
	    Running the analysis for each module/built-in.o file
	    tells where the mismatch happens much closer to the
	    source. The drawback is that the same mismatch is
	    reported at least twice.

	 sequences (on an arbitrary number of CPUs, running an
	 arbitrary number of tasks and interrupt contexts) cause a
	 deadlock.

	 In short, this feature enables the kernel to report locking
	 related deadlocks before they actually occur.

	 The proof does not depend on how hard and complex a
	 deadlock scenario would be to trigger: how many
	 participant CPUs, tasks and irq-contexts would be needed
	 for it to trigger. The proof also does not depend on
	 timing: if a race and a resulting deadlock is possible
	 theoretically (no matter how unlikely the race scenario
	 is), it will be proven so and will immediately be
	 reported by the kernel (once the event is observed that
	 makes the deadlock theoretically possible).

	 If a deadlock is impossible (i.e. the locking rules, as
	 observed by the kernel, are mathematically correct), the
	 kernel reports nothing.

	 NOTE: this feature can also be enabled for rwlocks, mutexes
	 and rwsems - in which case all dependencies between these

	help
	  If you want to debug problems which hang or crash the kernel early
	  on boot and the crashing machine has a FireWire port, you can use
	  this feature to remotely access the memory of the crashed machine
	  over FireWire. This employs remote DMA as part of the OHCI1394
	  specification which is now the standard for FireWire controllers.

	  With remote DMA, you can monitor the printk buffer remotely using
	  firescope and access all memory below 4GB using fireproxy from gdb.
	  Even controlling a kernel debugger is possible using remote DMA.

	  Usage:

	  If ohci1394_dma=early is used as boot parameter, it will initialize
	  all OHCI1394 controllers which are found in the PCI config space.

	  As all changes to the FireWire bus such as enabling and disabling
	  devices cause a bus reset and thereby disable remote DMA for all
	  devices, be sure to have the cable plugged and FireWire enabled on
	  the debugging host before booting the debug target for debugging.

	  This code (~1k) is freed after boot. By then, the firewire stack
	  in charge of the OHCI-1394 controllers should be used instead.

	  Compiles debug level messages into the kernel, which would not
	  otherwise be available at runtime. These messages can then be
	  enabled/disabled based on various levels of scope - per source file,
	  function, module, format string, and line number. This mechanism
	  implicitly enables all pr_debug() and dev_dbg() calls. The impact of
	  this compile option is a larger kernel text size of about 2%.

	  Usage:

	  Dynamic debugging is controlled via the 'dynamic_debug/control' file,
	  which is contained in the 'debugfs' filesystem. Thus, the debugfs
	  filesystem must first be mounted before making use of this feature.
	  We refer the control file as: <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control. This
	  file contains a list of the debug statements that can be enabled. The
	  format for each line of the file is:

		filename:lineno [module]function flags format

	  filename : source file of the debug statement
	  lineno : line number of the debug statement
	  module : module that contains the debug statement
	  function : function that contains the debug statement
          flags : 'p' means the line is turned 'on' for printing
          format : the format used for the debug statement

	  From a live system:

		nullarbor:~ # cat <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control
		# filename:lineno [module]function flags format
		fs/aio.c:222 [aio]__put_ioctx - "__put_ioctx:\040freeing\040%p\012"

		fs/aio.c:1770 [aio]sys_io_cancel - "calling\040cancel\012"

	  Example usage:

		// enable the message at line 1603 of file svcsock.c
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'file svcsock.c line 1603 +p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

		// enable all the messages in file svcsock.c

	  Intel TXT will provide higher assurance of system configuration and
	  initial state as well as data reset protection.  This is used to
	  create a robust initial kernel measurement and verification, which
	  helps to ensure that kernel security mechanisms are functioning
	  correctly. This level of protection requires a root of trust outside

	  Intel TXT also helps solve real end user concerns about having
	  confidence that their hardware is running the VMM or kernel that
	  it was configured with, especially since they may be responsible for
	  providing such assurances to VMs and services running on it.

config BCH_CONST_PARAMS
	boolean
	help
	  Drivers may select this option to force specific constant
	  values for parameters 'm' (Galois field order) and 't'
	  (error correction capability). Those specific values must
	  be set by declaring default values for symbols BCH_CONST_M
	  and BCH_CONST_T.
	  Doing so will enable extra compiler optimizations,
	  improving encoding and decoding performance up to 2x for
	  usual (m,t) values (typically such that m*t < 200).
	  When this option is selected, the BCH library supports
	  only a single (m,t) configuration. This is mainly useful
	  for NAND flash board drivers requiring known, fixed BCH
	  parameters.

config BCH_CONST_M
	int
	range 5 15
	help
	  Constant value for Galois field order 'm'. If 'k' is the
	  number of data bits to protect, 'm' should be chosen such
	  that (k + m*t) <= 2**m - 1.
	  Drivers should declare a default value for this symbol if
	  they select option BCH_CONST_PARAMS.

config BCH_CONST_T
	int
	help
	  Constant value for error correction capability in bits 't'.
	  Drivers should declare a default value for this symbol if
	  they select option BCH_CONST_PARAMS.

config AVERAGE
	bool "Averaging functions"
	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
	  modules require averaging functions, but a module built outside
	  the kernel tree does. Such modules that use library averaging
	  functions require Y here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CORDIC

	help
	  The option provides arithmetic function using cordic algorithm
	  so its calculations are in fixed point. Modules can select this
	  when they require this function. Module will be called cordic.
